# BustaBit Data Analysis
This is a independent project dedicated to beating the BustaBit system. This project is centered around the Bitcoin gambling website: https://bustabit.com 

If you're not sure how it works, check it out for a while. You can watch the games, and not participate. Actually, I would recommend not participating, as gambling is a really irresponsible habit, and bitcoin gambling is illegal in some jurisdictions. With THAT being said, let's get on to the good stuff.

## The hypothesis
So, in the chat of bustabit, there are chat commands where you can calculate the probability of your multiplier NOT busting. These are not padded probabilities, they're taken straight from datasets within the game. To calculate probability, you go in the SPAM chat channel and you issue a command like this: ```!prob 1.1``` and that would tell me the probability of rolling >= 1.1x is 89.9264%. Simply put, if I bet 10,000 bits (around $14.78 at the time of typing this), there is an 89.9264% chance of me getting $1.48 in profit. Obviously, this is very oversimplified, but you get the gist of it. For reference, a bit is a millionth of a bitcoin. It's a way of dividing a bitcoin into a smaller, simplified unit.
